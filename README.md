# Multilingual Code-Mix NLP Analyzer – Frontend

A modern **React + TailwindCSS** web interface for interacting with a Multilingual NLP Analysis API focused on **code-mixed Indian social media text**.

This frontend provides an intuitive UI to test and visualize NLP outputs such as sentiment, toxicity, profanity, translation, and language detection.
**All model inference is handled by the backend API** — this project does not perform NLP locally.

👉 Backend repository:
[https://github.com/ananikets18/code-mix-social-media-python-backend](https://github.com/ananikets18/code-mix-social-media-python-backend)

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

## 🎯 Project Overview

Code-mixed and romanized Indic languages (e.g., Hinglish) are common on social media but poorly supported by standard NLP pipelines.
This frontend bridges that gap by offering a clean interface to explore multilingual NLP outputs powered by fine-tuned transformer models.

---

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

* Node.js (v16+ recommended)
* npm
* Backend API access (live or local)

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Backend API

**IMPORTANT:** The backend must be reachable before launching the frontend.

Default live backend URL:
`https://139.59.34.173.nip.io/`

If you want to run the backend locally instead:

```bash
# From the backend or parent project directory
python api.py
```

Your local API should be available at:
`http://localhost:8000`

---

### 2. Run the Frontend

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm start
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to view the application.

## 📌 Notes

* This repository is intended as a **frontend client** for NLP experimentation and visualization.
* All ML models and inference logic live in the backend.
* Designed for research, demos, and educational use.
